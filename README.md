# $${\color{lightgreen}2023\space NDVI\space MAP\space OF\space GHANA}$$  

## _Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Map of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with Python🐍_.
🚨This analysis is crucial for monitoring agricultural productivity, assessing environmental changes, and planning sustainable land management practices. 





## **🗺️ NDVI Map:**

Visual representation of vegetation health across Ghana, highlighting areas with varying vegetation density.
The NDVI map of Ghana in 2023 represents the mean composite of NDVI values for the entire year. This means the map is generated by averaging the NDVI values from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery collected throughout 2023. By using a mean composite, we ensure that the map reflects the overall vegetation health and trends across different seasons, minimizing the impact of temporary changes or anomalies.

#### NDVI Value Ranges:

🏜️ Barren land, non-vegetated: -0.1 to 0.0

🌾 Bare soil, sparse vegetation: 0.0 to 0.1

🌱 Sparse vegetation: 0.1 to 0.2

🌿 Moderate vegetation: 0.2 to 0.4

🌳 Healthy vegetation: 0.4 to 0.6

🌲 Very healthy vegetation: 0.6 to 0.8

🌳🌳 Extremely healthy vegetation, dense forest: 0.8 to 1.0





## **📈 Trend Analysis:**
